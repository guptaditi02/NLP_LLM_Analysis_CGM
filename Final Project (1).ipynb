My partner was diagnosed with T1D earlier this year, went into a life-threatening DKA and was hospitalized for a number of days. One of the many things I've learned as they've recovered and been using insulin and a CGM is that CGMs ain't cheap, even with pretty decent private insurance. The level of privilege and misinformation is strong with this one.\n",

That coupled with the fact I decided to hide my T1D because I felt embarrassed by it meant my control was terrible throughout my teens. After a few close calls with hypos and ending up in the hospital, I went on the minimed cgm pump and it’s truly a game changer. The control is second only to an actual pancreas with functioning beta cells.\n",

That should at least give me a cushion if a sensor fails and dexcom has to send a replacement. Then I'll cross my fingers and hope really hard that our awesome programmers in this community figure out a way to restart!\n",

Isn’t it crazy how we often brace for the worse and things work out for the better? Instead of the Doctor Chastising me for allowing my daughter to have continuous lows, she suggested that my daughter switch from finger pricks to using Dexcom G6. She explained that this was a better way to continuously  check her blood sugar levels without pricking herself. “The best part about Dexcom, she said, “is that it can be monitored on your smartphones and predict her extreme highs or lows within 30 minutes of the updated blood sugar levels. I asked my daughter if she wanted to try it and she decided she wanted to use it instead of pricking her finger multiple times a day. I can’t give a definitive review of the Dexcom G6 because we just started using this. I will be sure to include it in the next updated Dioabetes post. Diabetes is very serious if left untreated.\n",

      "Much better ways to get more accurate information This product is in beta still but I have used two other beta health improvement products this last year that were light years ahead in their product quality as well as their communication about the product and product problems. I ordered this product about the time I got a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) to monitor my blood glucose (BG), hoping to improve my health. The hope for this app, based on their product description, was to get similar feedback about what foods specifically were best for me to eat to improve my health, including BG levels and A1C. After all that is what they advertised their product did. ... However those same people also say diabetes is a degenerative disease and once you have it (including type II diabetes) you will over time get very severe health conditions and die early. As a potential user of this app, I suggest you look at some of the groups using the last 20 years of research and clinical data regarding managing diabetes (type I and type II). Type I diabetics, using a CGM are able to keep their blood sugars stable between 70 and 110 and avoid the wild roller coaster ride of BG steep rises and falls while not only improving their immediate health but also improving their long term health and life length. Type II diabetics can do this even easier. There is no reason to set the bar so low foe improving health (allowing spikes up to 180).\n",

      "This was very much the way monitoring stayed for me for some time: home blood glucose testing, HbA1c screening at six monthly appointments and annual eye screening to monitor for changes that might show early signs of diabetic retinopathy. In my little bubble, receiving annual GP check-ups away from hospital outpatient clinics, I was unaware of the monitoring transformation taking place. I managed to get myself fitted with an insulin pump in 2010, and, reading its instruction manual, I found a section on continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). Having set up the pump, I was equally keen to read up on the Enlite CGM made by Medtronic. CGMs work through a small 9mm sensor wire that is inserted into the skin and takes glucose readings from interstitial fluid every few minutes. A wireless transmitter attached to the sensor sent the readings to the pump. ... I would find results from the sensors to be too different from the blood test results for me to be confident in using them for decision making and alarms would sound incorrectly alerting me to problems that were not there. After persevering for a year, I gave up and returned to blood glucose monitoring only. Medtronic CGM \n",

      "A second look at the possibilities that CGM could provide came in 2014. My husband Neil ran the London Marathon for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF). When signing in at their registration desk, he struck up a conversation with a volunteer who enthused about Dexcom CGM sensors.   I had booked myself onto a JDRF Discovery Day the following month to hear Roman Hovorka talk about the research being funded by JDRF into closed loop systems. When I arrived, I asked the organisers if they knew any attendees using this Dexcom CGM. The rest is history! I was pointed in the direction of three different people, active in the type 1 community, who were happy to talk to me about their experiences. ... Slightly more kit had to be carried around but sensors could be restarted which I found allowed me to extend their accurate usage to 30 instead of 7 days and I could link readings to a pebble watch, giving me easy access to data on my wrist! xDrip workings\n",

      "Abbott developed the flash glucose monitoring system – Libre. I placed my first order in September 2016 to compare it to the Dexcom CGM. It was cheaper and sensors lasted 2 weeks but it was quite different from a CGM. The same interstitial fluid readings were used but rather than this data being read constantly with results pushed to a device that was capable of alarming for low or high blood glucose readings, trends could only be obtained by scanning the supplied rechargeable reader over the sensor. ... Apart from needing to recharge the transmitter daily, which could easily be accomplished whilst in the shower, the implanted sensor lasted three months. The benefit from this freedom was immense. Rushed mornings when packing two youngsters out of the house for school and getting myself ready for work were made even more stressful when adding in set changes for the insulin pump or CGM sensor changes. With their all having different usage times, you cannot co-ordinate processes to choose one day of the week when you put aside time to administer all that needs to be done in managing type 1. To have three months “freedom” from CGM duties saved a considerable amount of administration time. ... A CGM trend is like using a satnav. It shows you the route you have taken to get to where you are now, and how you are moving forwards. A closed loop system where a CGM communicates with an insulin pump is like a satnav with rerouting capabilities. As with the CGM trend, it shows the route you have taken to get to where you are now but will make insulin changes for you, to help to keep you on the route you wish to follow. I hope to gain access to a closed loop system in my 50th year of diagnosis.   Footnotes: 1.     \n",

This is why I suggest to get a CGM \\[Continuous Glucose Monitor\\] instead of Glucometer. Infact the CGM I have does function as both though I never used the strips. This CGM will give a clear indication on what foods cause the spike in bg and what cause a gradual spike. Just for example I ate overnight soaked oat meal for my lunch and my bg went up by 100 points in less than half hour and then in next hour it went down by 70 points.

However here is why I make that suggestion: if it is due to spikes in blood sugar, the CGM can give you immediate feedback so you can truly test and see what foods are impacting you. For example: sweetener alternatives such as stevia, monk fruit, Splenda, etc. You’ll meet a lot of people who tell you this will still make your blood sugar rise.

What it is really good at is showing trends and, for me at least, which specific foods are on the no-go list (bagels, beer, full sugar soda), which are on the occasional/limit list (baked potato (so long as there is a lot of fat with it), white rice (I can have sushi, but not massive amounts of the rice), the occasional slice or 2 of good sourdough, and of all things hard boiled eggs if consumed first thing in the morning), and which are on the good to go list (anything w/out carbs, \"keto\" ice cream, full fat dairy) We all react differently to different types of \"sugar/carbs\".\n",

Currently the leading cause of kidney failure in the US right now that leads to dialysis which is usually lifetime unless you get a transplant, is diabetes and high blood pressure. By applying a CGM on T2D, doctors and other healthcare professionals can manage a patient's glucose levels better because you can't rely on a patient.

The following is an excerpt from the article, I've put in bold a statement in the last paragraph: Quote: : \"There is no doubt that the device, the FreeStyle Libre, which the HSE has been reimbursing some patients for since 2018, is a revolutionary way to monitor blood-glucose levels for people with diabetes. Rather than prick a finger and squeeze a drop of blood on to a testing strip, a patient could stick a coin-sized sensor with a tiny probe to their upper arm. The painless probe barely pierces the arm, measuring glucose constantly via liquids just under the skin and giving a readout with the swipe of an electronic reader. ... If I saw a spike Id know what had caused it and avoid that food, because I had the memory of the spike, rather than weighing myself every day and thinking, Its going okay overall. In 2018, Douglas founded MyLevels. The startup, which is in the testing phase, pairs FreeStyle Libre sensors with its own app to understand the effects of foods on an individuals glucose response, using artificial intelligence to recommend a personalised diet. A lot of diets will tell you not to eat when your sugar levels crash, says Douglas, who is from Edinburgh and has a masters degree in machine learning. We say: Dont spike too much in the first place. ... Foods are then scored as part of a new recommended diet that aims to avoid sugar spikes. Douglas is not alone. The use of continuous glucose monitors in healthy individuals is an exploding area, says Sarah Berry, a senior lecturer in nutritional sciences at Kings College London and an expert in postprandial metabolism, or the way we respond to food.\" As this technology evolves, I think about the article Janet posted on the tool, Compass, from Tufts University.

Like to be stealthier than that, and it would be physically uncomfortable - Legs: too hairy, not enough fat - Upper butt: For some reason, when I remove the site there's a hard lump where the insulin went in and that makes me extremely uncomfortable, I'm pretty afraid of lipohypertrophy.\n",

[The Of Freestyle Libre] [Free Back Brace - An Overview] [See This Report about Freestyle Libre] [All about Freestyle Libre] [Free Back Brace for Beginners] [The Definitive Guide to Free Back Brace] When people believe of back supports, I'm certain the Hulk Hogan gym belt comes to mind. Some of the advantages that back braces might provide consist of: Much less tension and also stress on the back throughout powerful efforts of the back, Aiding to preserve better position while bending and lifting, Raised spinal support by tensing the spinal column, Restricting turning as well as flexing activities (array of movement), which may avoid further injury Usually, one of these reasons: After reduced back surgical procedure. After an acute (brand-new) reduced back injury. ... The biggest issue I emphasize to individuals is that braces should not used as a crutch, since you'll conveniently become dependent on them. When you drop that route, brand-new issues begin to rear their awful head. The Main Principles Of Freestyle Libre The body will certainly start to depend on the assistance provided by the brace, and reduce the natural stamina and also security of the low back. The end outcome is the back being placed at higher danger of future injury than it would have been had the support not been used. Put simply, dental braces need to never be used as a substitute for treatment. ... If you're not sure if you must be wearing a back support or not, speak with your chiropractic specialist. A back brace can aid you by providing additional support for your spine and also muscle mass. See This Report about Freestyle Libre Using a back support can also help you experience your day-to-day activities without triggering extra pressure to your back - freestyle libre. Especially with activities like bending as well as raising. Together with great training strategies, a back brace can help a severe injury heal faster and protect against more injury to an already wounded location.\n",

Like her back-up DexComs and transmitter. I also made it clear that I did not want her scanned since she had her Tandem pump around her waist and her DexCom G6 on her arm. Maybe I'm just being paranoid - I don't know if it would screw up these gadgets' readings. They let her pass through easily and they only dabbed something on each of her palms.\n",

      "I have had all three (freestyle 1, 2 and the dexcom g6) I would say that if you are really slender, the dexcom may be painful. It has a much longer filament that goes into your skin compared to the freestyle 2. I like the libre 2 the best. It is the most accurate out of the three for me (within 0.5mmol/l usually a tiny bit higher than my blood glucose) whereas the dexcom and the libre 1 were 1 to 2 mmol/l lower than my blood glucose. The freestyle 1 sucks as far as stickiness. The dexcom stays on well, as does the libre 2. You should be fine with showering/bathing, just don‘t soak it for a long time without a patch. You can get a product like skin tac to put on with any of the sensors to provide additional adhesive to help it stick better. ... If you’re in Europe I would try the freestyle 3 just because it is smaller. The 1 and 2 are very comfortable to wear. The dexcom is pretty bulky and sticks out a lot but you can wear it on stomach or thighs. The freestyle sensors are only approved for back of arms (other diabetics wear them elsewhere, I haven’t).

I'm a techie nerd guy who likes access to his data. I work in data in my career. So Dexcom was pretty awesome in this regard. As I'm using up my last dexcom sensors, I've been trying to figure out how best to get my Libre 2 data. Unfortunately, everything that works for Libre, Libre 14 day, and Libre 2, will likely stop working for Libre 3. So I'll be facing another major change in my management when that time comes.

      "I’ve been using the Dexcom G6 for a couple months now. The Dexcom G6 is a CGM. Before I started using the Dexcom G6, I was using the Freestyle Libre 2, which is technically a flash glucose monitoring device, but it can still be lumped into the category of CGMs. The Dexcom G6 has multiple advantages over the Freestyle Libre 2, such as being able to pair with the T-Slim insulin pump (which isn’t relevant to me since I don’t have that pump) and being able to send your blood sugar numbers to your phone. Despite that, I still didn’t want to switch to it because it’s bigger than the Freestyle Libre 2, and it’s supposed to go on your abdomen instead of the back of your arm like the Freestyle Libre 2. I used to use my abdomen and only my abdomen for insulin injections before I got my insulin pump, so I didn’t want anything taking up prime real estate over there. Even though the Dexcom G6 technically hasn’t been approved for use on the back of the arm, a lot of people wear it there anyways, but I guess I like to follow the rules. Considering that I had all these problems with the Dexcom G6, you might be wondering why I decided to switch to it. Well, I was kind of forced to try it out. I had two Freestyle Libre sensors fall off on the same day. ... I went to the nurse’s office and the poor school nurse spent half an hour with me trying to get it in properly, but we weren’t able to. I got it figured out once I got home, but I didn’t have readings the whole time I wasn’t at school, which isn’t a great situation to be in when you go low a lot and have hypoglycemia unawareness, but thankfully nothing bad happened. Now that I’ve gotten used to the Dexcom G6, I actually like it more than the FreeStyle Libre 2. The FreeStyle Libre 2 made a beeping sound every time I scanned my sensor, which drew unwanted attention in school. You can turn off the beeping noise, but then you don’t hear the alarms either, so that’s a problem. ... Instead it sends my blood sugar number to my phone and updates that number automatically every five minutes. There’s also a follow app so that my mom can see my blood sugar on her phone. The downside of the periodic updates is that when I’m at a point where, for example, my blood sugar is low and I’m waiting to see if I’ve come back up yet, I have to wait until the transmitter sends my number to my phone again, whereas with the FreeStyle Libre 2 I could scan my blood sugar whenever I wanted. The problem with the FreeStyle Libre 2 was that I used to get a lot of sensor errors, which is where the sensor wouldn’t give me blood sugar readings for anywhere between five minutes to half an hour. With the Dexcom I haven’t been getting any sensor errors, besides when I’m too far away from my phone. (More than 20 feet away.) I also haven’t had any defective sensors, besides one that started giving me false lows on the last day when it was time to change it anyways, while I had two or three bad sensors with FreeStyle Libre. The nice thing about the FreeStyle Libre was that it only had to be changed once every two weeks. The Dexcom G6, on the other hand, needs to be changed every 10 days. Towards the end of those 10 days the edges of the adhesive start peeling off, but I just use Skin Tac to keep it on and I haven’t had a sensor fall off yet. Although the FreeStyle Libre does have a few advantages over the Dexcom G6, I still prefer my Dexcom. The Dexcom G6 is more expensive, however. There’s good reasons to get either, or a different CGM entirely. It really depends on the individual person and what works best for them, and for me that’s the Dexcom G6. Update: The day after I posted this and said that I hadn’t gotten any sensor errors, I got a sensor error, however it resolved itself in half an hour.\n",

Never actually used them, but after doing some research I gathered they were somehow finding a way to repackage a Freestyle Libre at a slightly higher price and integrating it into some app they developed, which may or may not justify the higher price. Alternatively, if you're pre-diabetic, insulin resistant, etc, perhaps your doctor might be open to prescribing you a CGM. If you're able to go that route and live in the US, make sure they don't prescribe a Freestyle Libre 2 since the way it's currently crippled (no support for data transfer to your cell phone) makes it all but useless for what you're trying to achieve. You'd want the original 14-day Libre for what you're trying to do. If you sense some frustration in that last paragraph, that's because my doctor screwed up and after telling her multiple times during the appointment I needed the original Libre, she prescribed me the Libre 2, and I didn't catch this until I'd already brought the reader and sensor home with me from the pharmacy.\n",

      "Sleepless nights are unfortunately often a part of Type 1 Diabetes. All of the symptoms that you've listed are correctly attributed to hyperglycemia, or high blood sugar. The best thing you could do is get on a CGM, whether Dexcom G6 (the best, in my not so humble opinion) or Libre, and get your blood sugar under control. High blood sugar will do the most long term damage to your body, so it's definitely in your best interest to keep it under control, and with the proper tools it can be easier than you think. Those dry, cottonmouth wakeups to go pee in the middle of the night are awful, I know. Another thing that can really help, especially at night, is a closed loop pump, like the Tandem T:Slim X2. Working alongside your CGM it will attempt to keep your blood sugar under control through the night, and it can be remarkably successful. That's still another thing. CGMs and pumping will alleviate two of the concerns that you had (injecting yourself regularly and finger pricking to test blood glucose).\n",

If the insertion site gets pulled out or damaged, you'll need to replace it with a new one. There isn't a way to put it back in. This will be annoying when it happens :) If sugars aren't responding then yes, replace the infusion set, and maybe the cartridge and insulin.

That being said, I'm less strict about this now that I have had it for longer and am more confident. * PUSH your specialist team to give you access to Freestyle Libre 2 ASAP. If there's a delay you can also buy them online yourself. This is an absolute game-changer and one of the criteria for starting it ASAP is that at work as a junior doctor it is more challenging to be pricking your finger all the time. Freestyle Libre 2 gives you alarms for low/high glucose which is helpful, especially after long shifts as I discovered that after coming home late in the evening I would have night-time hypos. I now rarely have them because I know how much carbohydrate to snack on before bed, and I have the reassurance that if I am going low, the Libre alarm will wake me up if I don't myself. * You can also look online for the many DIY groups that crack diabetes technology to make it even better (at own risk).\n",

      "My partner is T1D, because of work sometimes One or both of us are away from home so she shared her Dexcom readings via the dexcom follow app. Sometimes whilst at work I’ll just have a glance and catch a double arrow down, ping her a text and make sure she’s seen it - she’s fiercely independent, which everyone can admire, but she does appreciate having a safety net when it comes to her BG. It’s a small gesture but it also helps me worry less, you feel like you’re doing more just by being able to check in every now and then - this is also a huge part of herself which she’s sharing, so I’m careful not to be overbearing and text her constantly!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Like my having lows but not having them in my cgm or meter. She's convinced that my low a1c is a result of too many lows and not control.\n",

      ":) From what I read, yes, once the Horizon comes out you should be able to upgrade. I hear that with the Dash, you're not locked in. I know with my Eros, I am locked in. But I don't mind it. Entering the numbers into the OmniPod PDM is so much better using the Dexcom. I guess my biggest inconvenience was the finger sticks. Since I don't really have to do that anymore, I love it.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Personally I’ve had very few wonky sensors and I don’t have a problem with bad readings or the adhesive. Dexcom will replace your sensor if you have an issue and they’ll also provide adhesive patches to go over the sensor which can help keep it on. I use Dexcom on the back of my arm and don’t have issues\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I have seen some people spray flonase allergy spray on the area before applying the dexcom. :)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I used a Medtronic pump with Medtronic CGM for about 3 years from 2015-2018. The pump worked great but the CGM was so unreliable it was laughable, and I met so many other type ones who had the exact same problem. When I switched to dexcom it was revolutionary. The CGM has worked so much better for me. I'm highly unlikely to ever consider Medtronic again given my experience. I also haven't had a single issue with the tandem t:slim pump since I started using it in 2018.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’ve used all three (including an old Medtronic model with Guardian CGM) and the Tandem/Dexcom combo works the best and is also the most reliable. First pump I’ve had with its own app and software updates!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I can get the Dexcom/tslim in like 2 years when the warranty is up on my Medtronic pump. I can’t wait. I e been debating calling up talim about a loaner or lease program or something.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "MDI preference here. I like the cheaper concept, less things attached to me, and let 3rd party software help indicate to me when it expects I may go high/low in 30 minutes using Dexcom and a smartwatch. Phone and a pen in a pocket and I’m good for the day. 95% TIR and 5.1 A1c so not convinced a heavy investment in a pump will make things easier/better, but always on the lookout for faster insulin and better accuracy in a CGM.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’ve the dexcom g6 and I love it!!! I’m very new to it ( like 5 days in) but it’s AMAZING!!!! So easy, seriously it’s great!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I don't get my dexcoms direct from Dexcom, but I do get replacements direct from them via support. (But not sure how it works for you specifically)\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hi I have had type 1 for almost 43 years and live in UK I have used a pump for about 15 years and for the past 11 years have used an Omnipod. I now use the Dash which is an updated version of the original Omnipod. I also have a Dexcom CGM as I have lost my hypo warning signs. For me the huge advantage of the Omnipod is no tubing. So there is no need ro detach anything when going in the ahower, there is nothing to get entangled in bed.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I had used a tubes pump since I was around 14 (now in my 30’s), and was hesitant to change to the pod initially because I felt that it would be annoying and be uncomfortable. I took the “leap” and started with Omnipod, and I would never go back to injections or a tubed if I have a choice. Around the same time of switching to Omnipod, I started on freestyle and then soon switched over to Dexcom G6 soon after so I was able to look into using a Rileylink so that I can now loop. My A1C was around 10 before switching everything up and now I’m consistently at a 6.5. I would highly recommend looking into it, and don’t go with the “Omnipod Dash” as it doesn’t work for looping. I use my pods on the back of my arms, but I have seen people use them in other areas.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "My husband’s sensor was knocked loose today and he had to replace it with a new one. The company already has one in the way which is great! Now to the problem.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It's all manual, I have the omnipod dash which doesn't link with a CGM. I just have the settings for bolus, basal and corrections working well after some trial and error.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Libre 2 was a nightmare for me too. Kept getting “sensor errors” that didn’t allow me to check for up to hours at a time. Switched back to libre 1 until I can get on omnipod/dexcom loop\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I use the Dexcom G6 and tslim x2 pump and it’s a complete game changer\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "If you are having Dexcom reading issues I would suggest trying to keep it on the abdomen and see how that goes. And stay hydrated, that’s very important. I also suggest Tandem Tru Steel insertion sets with a 6mm needle length. Works great to avoid kinks and sight issues. Tandem and Dexcom combo for me has been rock solid for the past couple years.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I tend to have to battle lows once a week or so. My endo and I talked this week though, and she finally talked me into a pump. I’ve had a Dexcom for years, which I love, and they work really well with the tandem pumps! They talk to each other so there’s little that needs to be done other than bolusing for carbs! I hope that you feel better soon!\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "He often lets his BG run high even with his tslim pump. The pump does its best and its probably why his A1C is in the 7’s and not higher. I highly recommend the Tandem tslim with the Dexcom g6.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Hey guys! So, this next week I am switching over from a Medtronic 670G to the dexcom and tandem basal IQ system. I would love your tips and tricks. I have pump training coming up, but all of the dexcom training is videos online. I'd also love recommendations for fun stickers, cases, and any other accessories that have made your life easier.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I tried Dexcom and didn’t like it. I love my libre. Personal taste.\n",

    "b) Real-time alert\n",
    "One significant advantage of CGMs is their ability to alert users about potential hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) events\n",
    "c) Continuous glucose monitoring, as the name suggests, should offer uninterrupted monitoring. Patients expect consistent data without extended periods of downtime or \"blind spots\" in the readings\n",

    "— Analyzed mostly using topic 4 and 7\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Understanding Sensor Limitations and Duration**:\n",
    "- Some users express doubts that certain models, like the Dexcom G6, can last their full advertised duration.\n",
    "1. **Technical and Software Challenges**:\n",
    "- Users experience issues related to connectivity, software glitches, and calibration errors.\n",
    "1. **Feature Awareness:**\n",

    "\n",
    "#### b. What benefits are most important to diabetes patients?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefits:** \n",
    "1. **Awareness of Emotional Attachment to Food**: Monitoring helps patients recognize and manage emotional eating and cravings. By tracking, individuals can identify when they're genuinely hungry or when it's just a craving, helping in maintaining stable sugar levels.\n",
    "2. **Safety and Real-time Monitoring**: Devices like Dexcom provide real-time glucose readings. While they might sometimes have issues like signal drops or discrepancies, they provide an immediate indication of glucose levels, which can be lifesaving, especially during nighttime.\n",
    "3. **Encourages Blood Testing for Accuracy**: Patients are often advised to perform a blood test if symptoms don't match device readings, reinforcing the importance of accurate data and regular monitoring.\n",

I currently started seeing a new diabetes nurse who has helped me tremendously but my levels are still struggling. I was using a Dexcom G6 to monitor my levels. However, due to a change in insurance, I was switched over to a normal glucometer. The issue is, I can not get blood to come out of my fingers.\n",

      "Hi! I’ve been a T1 for 40 years- I didn’t use a cgm until 6 months ago (I didn’t like the concept of wearing equipment 24/7). I have to say I LOVE IT (I wear a Dexcom g6)- it gives me so much more control over my blood sugars! Dexcom sent me a “dummy” sensor to wear before committing to a cgm (it didn’t have anything to insert and it gave me an idea of how it would feel on my skin). I tried it on my stomach but I wasn’t thrilled about the location (that’s the only site Dexcom authorizes in the US......hopefully that will change). I wear it on my bicep area, and I really like that location- I haven’t had any bad readings there (occasionally I need to calibrate it if the numbers drift), and that location doesn’t get bumped by any external forces (like door edges or counter corners). I really like knowing what my blood sugars are doing at any given moment, and it’s really helped me tighten up control of my blood sugars (that is something that has gotten more challenging over the years as I get older....dang my aging body!

      "I've been using the Dexcom for years and have also noticed the readings seem to have gotten more inaccurate recently. For the first time I'm having wildly inaccurate readings. Mostly similar to this, where it says I'm incredibly low but I'm 100+ points higher on a finger stick.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Protein definitely would take too long to correct lows... that might take over an hour. I have a CGM, so if I'm trending downwards, I could have a small handful of berries to even things out. But if I'm under 3.5 mmol/L I'll have a glucose tablet (4g of pure glucose) because that is the quickest way back over 4 mmol/L. Gluconeogenesis still works in Type 1s, but insulin suppresses it. The only reason for low BG in type 1s is taking too much insulin. My insulin pump is connected to the CGM, so if it detects that I am going to go low 30 minutes in the future, it will automatically suspend my basal of insulin, and I will rise back to normal over time. But glucose is still necessary if I've made a mistake and had too much insulin to cover a meal. It's hard to get it right all the time.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thank you for this information. This probably sounds silly but I didn’t know if using a different app with Dexcom would make getting the readings less adequate due to when the app would be giving the information. I’m aquatinted with diabox but have not used xdrip. I’m going to try this today.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Oh, it wasn't my first rodeo. I have a freestyle libre and the intake nurse said my phone must be malfunctioning so I hauled out my finger prick monitor showing that it was also reading LO. I was very lucky to be seen by a nurse/paramedic who I hope had a word with the intake nurse. My BG has been whacky this weekend.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "That said, my three BG meters--which all cal perfectly--produce essentially random numbers when measuring blood, with unrepeatable results and huge variations between meters, even from the **same** drop of blood. My endo and my primary will not identify which meter is right, nor will they even indicate which one they recommend most to trust. I trust IV draws at my endo, and my Dexcom G6 has great correlation with those IV draws (I make a note of the Dex reading when the draw is taken.) Correlation has not been larger than 10 points, and the Dexcom Clarity computed GMI matches my A1c within two tenths of a percent... consistently over the course of three years now.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I also like to set my \"high\" threshold lower (160) so I can start working on correcting before 180. Typically when I hit 180 I'm very likely going up to 200, and that just comes with knowing the body. Sugarmate is a really good helper if you have a smartphone and CGM capability because it shows the + and - near your bg reading, which helps me determine how soon I should pre bolus typically. But even without all that, it does just get better with time and adjusting of numbers. I was really scared to change any of my settings for years into my diagnosis, and that was what was dragging me down.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The last year and a half or so I became extremely paranoid of night time lows specifically (even tho they always wake me up) I would get scared what if they don’t wake me up anymore? I’d be checking my blood sugar 5 times in the hour before going to sleep and eating snacks when it was unnecessary. I finally switched to a cgm which helped immensely because remember, it will alert you if you’re low so you’ll have time to fix things! Even you hate going low too, I know the alerts are annoying but you could set it to a higher number to prevent a bad low altogether?\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "My GF having my Dexcom on her phone has been very helpful for me because when I’m low, the alerts don’t wake me up. She is generally up for 6 hours after I go to bed. However I don’t really need her telling me I’m low when I’m awake and I have 2 different devices beeping at me.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Another thing that makes this worse: The longer you run high, the higher your insulin resistance. So if it usually takes 10 units to get from 200 to 100, after 12 hours, it may now take 15, 20, sometimes more. When I manage to sleep through my dexcom alert and wake up with 160+ in the morning, I usually have to double my morning dose and run +20% or more most of the day before it finally normalizes.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Even then, severe lows are only really a risk when your diet is super carb heavy and you are having to bolus a lot of insulin to cover meals. Low carb diets are generally easier with minimal risk of severe lows. A CGM will also help ease your anxiety. I recommend a dexcom g6. You will see impending lows or highs before they happen so you will have more time to correct. Seriously, don’t be afraid of insulin.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’ve noticed (through continuous glucose monitor) that it’s keeping my blood sugar super low (like hovering around 85 even after eating with dips down below 70) and whenever my blood sugar is low my symptoms are the worst. I’m not diabetic. Not sure if maybe this is happening for you too.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "So, I have to assume that I'm not the only one who encountered this, but my insurance limits my finger stick testing to 2 times daily (with my Dexcom G6 coverage). I've been on a CGM for about 10 years. While it's amazing technology and keeps me from finger stick 10 or more times a day, that doesn't mean it's accurate enough to allow for that few tests. I find Dexcom \"no finger stick\" claim to be a blatant dangerous lie...\n",

I do not need to be told three separate times that my blood sugar is low, I CAN BLOODY FEEL IT AND THATS WHAT THE CGM IS FOR!!! I know that I’m not receiving insulin, IM THE ONE WHO STOPPED THE DELIVERY! I’m in the damn shower like let me live PLEASE!!! ... So stop treating me like a helpless little thing who needs their hand held through managing the disease I’ve had long before you even came out with this damned pump and let me turn off the fucking alarms if I want. (disclaimer: I fully realize these alarms are helpful to some people, my point is we should have more choice in what alerts we want to receive so that I’m not woken up 5x a night because my blood sugar is running high or I have less than X units left when that’s more than enough for half a day (if you think I’m getting up in the middle of the night to get a new cartridge when there’s plenty left you’ve lost your mind but don’t worry bby I’ll help you find it).)

      "(Okay the strips can be expensive but....) The insulins in common use tend to be more consistent in action and the fast ones are MUCH faster. Additionally we, in many cases, have access to continuous glucose monitors (CGMs). Together this means death from hypo is rarer now than it used to be. Secondly it is actually difficult to die from a hypo. ... Run a test. Make a note of how much 5g or 10g of carbs raise your blood glucose. If you can, get a CGM. They can help a lot. Additionally, make a plan, before hand, how you will treat a low. ... How high my previous average blood sugar was. (Being consistently high can make a healthy range feel low.) In practice a CGM helps me by letting me treat before it actually gets out of range. I can also get an idea of how quickly things are changing. (I have treated a low while my finger prick test said I was still at 83 because I felt a bit low, had insulin active and could see a downward trend.)\n",

And second, being that my daughter is just 5 (diagnosed at 4), we were able to fight insurance to get her on a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM), which helps us not to need to do finger sticks to check her (remember Nick Jonas’s super bowl commercial?). Otherwise, there’d be MANY more steps below. We decorate ours with cute stickers and my daughter proudly shows them off (much to her brothers’ frustrations about talking to literally everyone she sees). ... I’m going to skip here and get us close to bedtime, as I think I’m making my point. 8pm – at bedtime we have to dose her long-acting insulin, as well as any insulin that may be needed if her glucose number hasn’t leveled out AND if it’s been more than three hours since her last dose of insulin. From 8pm-8am (while she sleeps) – her CGM will beep, LOUDLY, if her glucose is going high or low. Lows mean I have to wake her up enough to drink some juice or have some applesauce.

I was also quite happy to increase my dose, updose and maintain as I felt necessary.

      "Precheck x 100000%. The only times I ever get an extra pat down is when I have to use the body scanner as my omnipod and CGM show up. That really never happens with Pre check (except for international flights on airlines that don't support pre check). It will make your life a lot easier.\n",

      "I've been using it for about 6 months now. I've had some that really stay, and some that crap out for seemingly no reason. It's a headache, I know. I've found some work arounds: only put it where the thing indicates (further on the back of the arm, than the side); Clean the location with soap and water, and then 'rough up' the skin just a little with an emory board; if I'm concerned with the adhesive still loosening after that, I put a large bandage on it just as added support. All of that has massively helped with keeping the unit on for the two weeks.\n",

Many of us on there (myself included) were not able to get the cgm script (no one has been able to give me a good explanation as to why), so we are left checking blood the old fashioned way. I have to check 4x's per day, but there are some women whose mfm requires more testing. Good luck to your sister and you\n",

You could try giving them a call to get more specific information about how the vitamin C could affect your numbers. Whenever my Libre shows my number as high, I then do a finger pick because the blood glucose reading is 'real time', whereas the Freestyle Libre sensor is measuring interstitial fluid and there is a lag time of about 10min with that.\n",

      "Your blood sugar moniter is not really much more accurate than Dexcom is! I have been diabetic for 31 years and I understand that changing mindset and trusting technology can be a challenge. To be approved (in the US, and I believe we have about the strictest rules) a meter must be within 15% of lab values 95% of the time and within 20% 99% of the time. ... Neither treatment would be any farther off than the other under these circumstances. We were always taught to believe our meters, and now many believe their meter over Dexcom even though there is no more accuracy in a meter (though there is less to fail). Some people do find Dexcom to not be highly accurate, usually due to medication affects, dehydration, or insufficient body fat in site location, but for most Dexcom is usually very accurate (within 10% according to FDA filings). As for trend arrows, Dexcom can only predict based on past blood sugar results. If your blood sugar is rising rapidly but reaching a peak before heading the other direction, or crashing but about to turn Dexcom can't predict this but you should be able to (you know you took insulin, ate, exercised, etc which Dexcom can't use in its predictions). Otherwise the trends are generally fairly accurate (assuming no outside influence Dexcom's prediction would be correct). They are a tool to use, not a certainty that your next blood sugar will be 17 points higher than the last one. Again dehydration, insufficient fatty tissue for site placement, and some medications can affect this as well. If you are an individual that has more challenges with Dexcom's accuracy you might try increasing your fluid intake (most people are at least slightly dehydrated- you should never feel thirsty), and discussing your medications and sensor placement with your doctor. Sensors preform best in fatty tissue, which can pose a challenge for many. Before I got an insulin pump and Dexcom in 2015 my A1c was 12+. I have severe gastroparesis and don't digest most of the food I eat, and what I do digest can take hours or digests unpredictably at strange times. I kept my blood sugars high and only took correction insulin as I had some terrifying lows and had no support at home. ... I finally was approved for an insulin pump (I had been trying to get one for years but first had an endocrinologist that hated them and refused to prescribe it then had my employer play musical insurance, never allowing me time to build the necessary relationship to get a pump approved) and really improved my A1c (<7.2), but this resulted in ambulance calls 2 or more times per month due to extreme low blood sugars. I took 12 or more blood sugars a day, but still had no ability to control my sugars. I started paying, out of pocket, for Dexcom in late spring 2015, after my mom came home to find me passed out across my bed (where I fell) and barely breathing, having gone through convulsions. When the paramedics arrived my blood sugar was still below 20 (meaning my body had no reserves left to save me). Since starting using Dexcom in 2015 I have not had a single low requiring an ambulance or trip to the hospital. ... You can use exercise mode (where it doesn't treat highs) or sleep mode (where it sets a much smaller allowable sugar range) to help get the results you want, and you are still fully able to set your own correction doses, meal doses, and suspend delivery as you see fit. As a closed loop system, it has a long way to go, but for preventing serious lows and highs Control-IQ is amazing. To stay safe I use Dexcom share with my parents as followers. They are notified if my blood sugar is below 80 for 30 minutes or if it ever falls below 55 so they can help make sure I stay safe. If my blood sugar has been low a while they will call me or check on me and if I'm urgently low and not responding they can call my boyfriend or an ambulance to make sure I get help.\n",

      "I used to wind up in the hospital 2-3 times a year. Couple of comas (blood sugar over 1700 for the most severe one), being found unconscious having seizures in various places, etc. I am far from a perfect diabetic now, my most recent A1C was 6.9, but it took having a heart attack and triple bypass at 40 yrs old to TRY and make any changes. Things I suggest, see a therapist if you can, get on a pump and CGM if you are not (the pump and CGM was a game-changer for me) get yourself a good support team (friends, family, spouse/significant other) Make small changes rather than try and change everything all at once.\n",

      "I’ve been on a CGM for three years and in all that time I’ve yet to get a A1C below 7.0. My last two were 7.0, yet I’m in range 94% of the time. And when I’m not in range, I’m usually low. Fingerstick checks are always higher. I try to calibrate but half the time I do that I wind up in a never-ending “calibrate sensor in 15 minutes” at which point I contact tech support and they tell me to use a new sensor. So I’m scared to calibrate. Before using a CGM I’ve been as low as 6.1. I love the convenience of the CGM but I am seriously concerned about its accuracy. I’m using the Dexcom G6.\n",

Get yourself a certified diabetes educator too - they can be a great resource until you get your feet under you! I asked for a continuous glucose monitor a month after being being diagnosed. LADA folks benefit greatly from this because we still produce insulin. It has been a life saver. I also went on an insulin pump 4 months after being diagnosed because since I still produce insulin being locked into a once daily basal insulin just wasn't working for me. Some days I needed 8u and some days none so a pump was the best option (also since the pump I use will shut down giving me insulin if my BG is trending low). I use a Dexcom G6 CGM and the Tandem T-Slim X2 for my pump (which grabs readings from my CGM to help make automatic basal rate decisions) and am super happy with the combo. My a1c is generally between 5 - 5.6% now. Quarterly bloodwork is pretty standard for diabetics in general although I tend to only go twice a year due to my work schedule.\n",

If it is just the Dexcom that has run out, your gf can go to a pharmacy without a prescription to get rest strips for her glucometer (and she should be able to get a free glucometer with the purchase of strips) and she should be fine with that until she can get more dexcom supplies. In some areas, pharmacists can even we Rite prescriptions for strips so that it can go through insurance. If she is out of pods for Omnipod, this is much more serious.\n",

Whether that's under a certain income level or after your family maximum is paid? (I have no deductible to pay for my income level) What % of the Dexcom prescription is supposed to be covered \\*before\\* the maximum, if that's the case? Because what I've paid so far is definitely not 30% of the total cost (Pharmacare states 70% prescription coverage until family maximum reached, as far as I understood) To explain, I was approved for special authority coverage at the start of the year, I've paid for 2 boxes of sensors at $275/each and have been told they retail at about $390/each.

Having a CGM that can alert me with alarms has been life changing for me and has dramatically improved my quality of life as a hypoglycemia unaware diabetic. One of the things I really don’t like about the G6 is that the alerts are actually fairly unreliable for me. I use an iPhone (iOS 15) and the mode that is supposed to make alarms ignore my phone being on silent just don’t work. ... I often forget where my sensor is when I’m getting into bed (I don’t like sleeping on it) or when I’m showering and I end up dropping the washcloth because I get it caught on my sensor when I’m not paying attention. Get whichever system your insurance will pay for. The Dexcom G6 integrates with more other medical devices so if you think you might want a pump maybe lean that way if your insurance pays for both the G6 and Libre 2.

      "If you rely on diabetes technology like an insulin pump, CGM, Freestyle Libre, or other glucose monitoring device, then you will have to deal with its failure at some point. This week I encountered a surprise error while trying to calibrate the sensor for my Medtronic 670G Insulin Pump. I use the Guardian 3 Transmitter with it for continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). It’s a wonderful feature of this pump because it will automatically adjust the insulin dose based on the sensor’s reading. Plus, I can see what my glucose is at any time by just looking at my insulin pump. However, this continuous glucose monitoring requires me to calibrate the sensor at least twice a day. Since calibration is something I do several times every day, it’s become super normal and easy. I just test my blood glucose using a meter and then program that number into the pump and select calibrate. ... It may be disconnecting and re-pairing a device. It may be restarting it. It may be unplugging the power and then waiting a few minutes and then plugging it back in. Handling CGM Failure Gracefully I’ve heard people refer to a CGM as a luxury. I know that not everyone who uses insulin has a way to continuously monitor their glucose. However, for those of us who are used to relying on a CGM for this, it can be very stressful to go without. My goal is to make the outage as brief as possible. I keep back ups of supplies on hand.\n",

Unlike previous generations, this CGM system is factory-calibrated—so no fingersticks are required. * The Dexcom G6 is comprised of a sensor, transmitter and display device (receiver and/or compatible smart device)**. The system features a redesigned, one-touch auto-applicator and sleek, discreet transmitter. The Dexcom G6 sends glucose readings to a compatible smart device or the Dexcom receiver every 5 minutes. The Dexcom G6 is indicated for patients ages 2 and older. https://www.dexcom.com/faqs/what-is-dexcom-g6-cgm-system You can also visit the r/dexcom community.\n",

      "It was just a joke, because I prefer Libre. Fewer features, but fewer problems.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Love the optimism. I can say with 100% certainty that Tandem and Dexcom's support are top notch. The wait times are tough, hence the call back feature, but everything about them is great.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Small, nice touchscreen, easy to use, amazing software and features. Only downside is filling the cartridge is a wee bit cumbersome, but not a punishment or anything. The Medtronic is good too, but very bulky and if you are able to get rt-CGM: their Guardian sensors really suck and their software is very annoying. Medtrum and Omnipod you’ve got to be in to if that’s the kind of pump you want; both aren’t as smart as the tandem or Medtronic but they’re good pumps. The ypsopump is nice and small as well, but very limited in ability; yet still a solid choice, but you’d be wayyyyy better off with the tandem. I would go for the T:Slim X2 and did so myself as well. Especially if you qualify for rt-CGM. Dexcom G6 is amazing and ControlIQ really helps! But I believe in UK you won’t get it fast and are more likely to get FGM/freestyle libre as a sensor.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Most of these features I couldn’t care less about, but direct to watch would be incredible, that would give me so much more freedom, and maybe even the ability to use cgm while swimming/snorkeling! I’ve been hoping for this for years.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm getting a new cgm/pump because the medtronic one expired. Anyways I'm done with medtronic. Omnipod seems great with all the features I want but idk if it's coming out soon or if I would be able to return the dexcom or trade in my current 670g for a discount or anything.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think Medtronic's stand-alone CGM uses a phone so I don't know why that feature isn't available on the sensors that go with the pump.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I was on the original Tandem t:slim pump with Dexcom, before it had integration. My pump warranty was up and I was in the same situation as you with UHC, where I had to get a Medtronic pump. I was initially excited about the opportunity, because I wanted to try its artificial pancreas features. I was sorely disappointed with the entire Medtronic experience. The CGM calibrations are a nightmare. The entire Medtronic system is Byzantine in design and they seem to have no interest in doing any significant R&D or make design improvements. I took up Tandems offer to pay the $999 and get the new t:slim X2 with Control IQ.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Thanks for the insight on Onnipods! I was thinking of switching because it’s tubeless. I currently have a T-Slim X2 pump, it’s the only device I’ve used aside from my Dexcom CGM. They both “talk” to each other. The CIQ is a truly great function, it will auto correct a high.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "28F - T1D 22 yrs - pump/CGM -I have ALWAYS had that dawn phenomenon high issue. Between 3:30 - 6:30 AM I will shoot up - apparently it has something to do with our body getting ready for the day by burning some stored carbs or whatever. It can be hard to deal with when you’re on manual injections but the pump/CGM auto mode feature really helped me deal with them.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Check out the t slim. The automatic suspend function is amazing and has totally prevented most of my nighttime lows. I find it easier to use and more accurate than the Medtronic CGM/pump system.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I couldn't function without mine. But I do think there's a push to have a pump when it may not be needed. The CGM is invaluable though. I don't recommend Medtronic's CGM. Moved to that 4 years ago and have been counting the days to get back on a Dexcom. Dex is far more reliable and accurate, and generally less of a headache in my experience. I want to smash it into tiny pieces regularly.\n",

      "Yeah let me know if you find anything, dropping 300 a month on dexcom and another 80 on insulin is starting to get annoying while I'm waiting to get benefits at work.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "They measure your interstitial fluid, which lags behind blood glucose levels by about 15 minutes or so. I can see the trend graph is starting to increase, so it makes sense that the meter may be showing higher. For this reason, I try not to directly compare meter readings and CGM readings unless my CGM reading has been stable for a while. This is why the most important benefit of a CGM is actually the trend information, not necessarily the moment-to-moment readings. I hope this reduces some of your frustration.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I just put in a Freestyle Libre CGM 6 days ago and I haven’t been able to get the full benefits of it as I got diagnosed with Covid a day or two after inserted it. I will say it’s readings are actually pretty accurate if that helps in your decision in terms of which device to get as I’ve correlated the sensor data to standard pricks. The alarm actually went off in the middle of the night a few nights ago and woke me because I had been throwing up and had hypoglycemia and my BS had gotten quite low because of it.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Keep it short and sweet, my CGM and pump combo took my a1C from a 7.3 to a 5.3. It'ss about control. Biggest benefit to me is not having to worry about my supplies (did I bring enough pen needles). Oh, I'm at a place and they offer me food I wasn't anticipating?\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "For me, it is handy to have a little graph to see how my sugars are trending throughout the day. However, if a blood monitor like the one touch or contour next had a trend arrow beside the glucose number, I would toss my CGM in the trash immediately. The main benefit of the CGM is convenience, if you are out and about, you dont need to stop and do a blood test. It’s also like the difference between a text and a phone call. One gives you a history of the conversation, the other is a one time event.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "A CGM is helpful for any form of diabetes. It is most helpful if you are taking insulin because you have a continuous idea of where you blood sugar is. But it has other benefits. ... If you ever need insulin you will be checking much more frequently. If you're on something like Metformin, you do always kind of run the risk of lows. A CGM can help you catch drops early and allow you to effectively treat it. I wish I had gotten mine sooner. I was checking sugars manually and had a terrible A1C. But the CGM helped my endocrinologist figure out what exactly my insulin needs are. It actually showed that I needed to split my long acting insulin because I was spiking super high overnight. At first it was weird.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Much less expensive. Some people find they eat less since it’s a pain to have to take an injection when you want a snack. The benefits of the pump/CGM definitely outweigh these downsides though, for me!\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "You're probably just in a really long honeymoon period. I'd also point out that an A1C of 6 is not a non-diabetic A1C. So, you may want to stay on your Dexcom for 10 days and see if you're still going high and could benefit from a small amount of insulin. I did once see someone post online that they had a 7 year honeymoon period. But, that's highly unlikely.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Before I begin, I must also say that I have been brought up by great parents who taught me to eat everything, and so I do! If there is something that you don't like, there are loads of other diabetic recipes and ideas that you will eat and appreciate. I also guide to get the monitor from the pharmacy to check your readings every minutes and you will get benefits a lot and if want to get freestyle libre just clock the [link](https://cgmmoniter.getform.com/r27vj) and fill the [form](https://cgmmoniter.getform.com/r27vj).\n",

      "It’s harder to initially start since I don’t constantly do it and the first time will be more hard because my brain didn’t know the benefit at the time but I think around the week mark you get used to it. It really helps me realize the emotional attachment of food and cravings and that even though my brain is signaling I’m hungry I’m actually not and if I continue a little past it the gherlin stops peaking and I don’t feel hungry anymore without eating. I only started doing this truthfully when I had my CGM so I can constantly manage it and check on it but I had a lot of benefit and my blood sugars were a perfect flat line when I do it although everyone may be different. I kind of equate it to meditation where it’s hard at first but then it becomes easier and easier to be aware of your thoughts and not get so emotionally attached easily after about a week of doing so\n",

      "And I don't think that's going to change until America will ease off the \"personal responsibility, pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps\" frontier mentality a little. You do a perfect job of summarizing the advantages of CGM over finger stick testing. As a T1D who spent close to 15 years on BGM I must say it's not just the newly diagnosed who are \"flying with a blindfold\" without CGM. I mentioned in another thread how much of a difference thinking in terms of *curves* is a game-changer in diabetes management, and I am still learning how much that's true.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "It’s just frustrating to have to eat when I’m not hungry. I don’t want to keep changing things on my own, so I’ll wait and ask my dr. But I am curious - at what point would someone adjust basal rather than bolus? I would really like to get a CGM. My endo has told me we’ll talk about that later, but is there really much benefit in making me wait? I’m doing 5+ finger pricks a day, often times more because of the lows, then checking again 15 min later after trying to bring it up. ... Insurance only covers refills once a month. The document you sent was interesting, as was reading some of the patient’s experience. I don’t have a CGM so I’m not really used to interpreting the graphs yet. But hearing about how they were waking up to eat breakfast when they didn’t want to, added weight gain, depression. This is what I need to be reminded of - I should be able to have the insulin to cover my food, not eating more food to cover the insulin.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "The alarms can be slightly frustrating, but it’s so, so worth it. After all, the reason they’re annoying is so they get your attention in case of a dangerous low, so a little bit of annoyance makes sense. After a period of time you can get desensitized to to the feeling of a low, and without a cgm you could go low at night and not wake up, be unaware of it. The alarms in a case like this can truly be a lifesaver. Insertion hurts about as much as a finger prick at the doctor’s office. ... The trouble of inserting and taking off once every 10 days is much less than the trouble 50+ finger sticks in that same time frame. The benefits of the Dexcom far, FAR outweigh the annoyances. Of all of the things that have changed my life with regard to diabetes in the 15 years I’ve had type 1, the Dexcom without a doubt has had the biggest impact. I’ve seen studies (can’t remember the exact one but I can look if you want) where they surveyed all types of treatment regimes, pump+meter, pump+cgm, MDI+meter, etc, and the factor that made the biggest difference for A1C was the cgm. The problem with finger pricks is that you can’t truly see what’s going on. You’re getting snapshots every few hours of something that’s changing every minute. ... Overall, just get it, the pros outweigh the cons by a huge margin. If you hate it you can always stop using it, but it has been truly a night and day difference for me and many people that I know. I’m not a fan of some of the things Dexcom does as a company, but their product genuinely changed my life and I can’t recommend it enough.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I (47) have the Dexcom and my mother (77) has the Libre. Both have given us problems which have been covered in this sub. Both have their benefits as well. I will say that the Libre seems to alert my mother of lows or dropping BG patterns a little faster than my Dexcom does for me. My Dexcom is more reliable at alerting me to rapid rising BG although it will alert me when it senses its dropping too fast. The biggest differences is the Libre seems to be 1 piece every 14 days with the Dexcom 2 pieces, changing the sensor every 10 days and the transmitter every 90 days. The Dexcom displays your current BG (measured every 5 minutes) on the receiver (or compatible smart phone) while the Libre seems to require verification by scanning for your current BG regardless of the patterns its sensing. Price wise, I believe the Libre is less expensive overall than the Dexcom. I'm not sure about the Libre on this last point but the Dexcom displays rapid BG drops and can calculate how soon you'll drop below your urgent low level. Personally, we each like our systems respectively and don't consider switching. I hope that helps a little.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I think you'll benefit a lot from getting a cgm that wakes you up with an alarm when you're going low. I find it helps a lot to be less anxious about going low during the night\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Regarding patients who come in with CGM - my hospital will let us use them (for the patient’s benefit) but patient has to sign a waiver stating they know their results could be different from our finger sticks, and that if their blood sugar is treated inappropriately due to inaccurate readings on their machine’s part, we aren’t held liable. Usually if my patient comes in with one I will do finger sticks for 2-3 meals and compare them with the CGM readings. If they’re wildly different I will encourage the patient to let us continue doing finger sticks rather than use their CGM.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Nope nothing changes my thesis seeing as the Omnipod 5 only works up to 72 hours, yes it has its own advantage seeing as it provides constant insulin being pumped and monitors at the same time However, the Eversense CGM is only used for monitoring insulin levels but it only needs changing every 180 days. So guess we’ll see what happens in the future as they both have their own advantages so I can get why you think their technology is obsolete. Of course I’ll act accordingly with my investment but will definitely be holding until FDA approval and beyond if it’s all positive news and they actually become profitable in the future.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "My “low” range starts at 70, so if I’m at 70 I treat that low before I drive/get in car. I don’t always wait the full 15 minutes before driving if I’m 70, and I always bring along more liquid sugar (regular soda, juice, etc) in case it doesn’t come up as expected. I have the advantage of wearing a CGM, so it will tell me if I’m 70 and dropping. If dropping I wait it out before driving or have my husband drive. If steady but at 70, I treat and leave.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I take it twice a day. Before I started taking it I didn’t feel my lows 50% of the time anyway. I am on a CGM and took advantage of being able to take propranolol.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I haven’t passed out from lows (yet), but this thread legit scares the shit out of me! My hypoglycemic awareness has waned over the past couple years but I make a point to check my BG whenever I feel a little strange. I also have a pump and CGM which helps me immensely with monitoring my levels and pausing insulin delivery when needed. We also have a glucagon pen ready to go if I black out. However, as an ice and mountain climber, what really scares me is my chances of going low when I’m in the middle of nowhere, with no glucagon pen or cell service. My CGM died when I was in a remote area near Denali for a week - not fun. I obsessively stash glucose tablets everywhere but T1 is an annoying additional layer of risk during these activities. On the brighter side, with the benefits of modern pump technology, T1 hasn’t stopped me from doing the things I enjoy.\n",

      "Same situation here, pump are cheaply available, but CGM still cost a fortune, so i could get a pump by itself. I personally fine without it, i just use MDI and inject myself like 6-7 times a day. The only benefit would be more accurate dosing, i would LOVE to dose 0.5 units(why dont they sell less diluted insulin???), but thats overall a small benefit imo, not worth it to have something attached to your body 24/h and all the other extra issues that can come from a pump(bent canula, some accident destroying it/pulling it out somehow).\n",

      "The Medtronic rep was like, yeah...that's a long way off. My thinking at the time was any incremental benefit I could get would compound over the years.

      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "My control on MDI with no CGM was always pretty solid (A1C in the 6.7-7.2 range) with relatively minimal effort, so I never had a real medical reason for switching to pump or CGM. I realllly wanted to get on a pump because I had a lot of anxiety about taking injections in front of people, and so I made that switch like 11 years ago and really liked it. Definitely sometimes annoying to have a thing attached to you, but I hated carrying around pens and needles all the time, and so the pump was a HUGE step up for my lifestyle. ... It just got in the way, was super annoying, and I felt like I had to constantly be paying attention to it and dealing with calibrations and stuff. It just took more energy than it gave me benefit. About a year ago, at my doctor's recommendation I tried out the Dexcom G6 (not for medical reasons, just a \"hey, you haven't tried a CGM for like 5 years, the new Dexcom is pretty sweet\") and I absolutely love it. It's so simple, I never have to pay attention to it other than changing it once every 10 days. I no longer carry around my testing meter with me all the time, and my control is noticeably better with it.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "One time I had a septum piercing and I have such bad luck that everyone kept hitting me in the nose by accident causing it to stab me, I can see a lot of things happening with a pump. I've managed to get into the target A1C range with my pens and I've been using those the entire time, it's my lifestyle. I don't want another lifestyle change unless it will significantly increase my quality of life, and frankly, I don't think a pump will (CGM on the other hand is *chef kiss*). So money, lifestyle change, no real benefit, and accident prone. I've heard people rave about pumps, but I'm gonna hold out for a cure, real artificial pancreas, smart insulin, or something else of the sort.\n",

      "Finding the Right Tech for Me By Justine Szafran Centered around her desire to find the right combination that could give her the information she wanted and the simplicity she was craving, Justine Szafran embarked on a decade long journey to search for diabetes technology that would deliver her insulin and track her glucose. Diabetes produces a rollercoaster of emotions. Over the past 12 years, I think I’ve come to realize just how mentally taxing this process of trial and error can really be when trying to find the right combination of technology, be it an app, a blood glucose meter, a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGM), insulin pens, an insulin pump, or something else. When my glucose levels are in control, I’m on top of the world. When they’re not, it can feel like my sense of control is disappearing. ... Being an active teenager with a very regimented lifestyle and high levels of hormones meant using a pump like Animas offered a lot of advantages. Around the same time I started using my Animas pump, I also began using a continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ). I started with the Dexcom Seven Plus [this CGM is no longer available] and enjoyed not having to monitor my glucose levels manually with fingerstick tests. Having a CGM also meant that I had a wealth of information to make decisions around my insulin needs and understand how I was doing with my diabetes management. Especially overnight, I found that my Dexcom was invaluable. Dexcom announced a partnership with Animas back in 2008, so the potential to integrate my two devices was a big reason I chose them when picking a pump and CGM. But one of the most frustrating things I have found about diabetes tech through the years has been the false hopes that companies provide. For example, what ever happened to this partnership? ... These issues, including cooked insulin and losing track of the personal diabetes manager (PDM), which controlled the pod, were enough reasons for me to stop using Omnipod after three years. Around this time in 2016, the MiniMed 670G hybrid closed-loop system was approved. It combined its own CGM and insulin pump systems, linking them with an algorithm that automated basal insulin delivery. I was ready to give it a try. The promise of not having to manage all my diabetes on my own by having certain aspects of it automated sounded too good to be true. ... I used the MiniMed 670G insulin pump with the closed loop feature turned off and returned to a Dexcom CGM again (this time the G6 ). Finally, I found a CGM that I really loved. I can’t say enough good things about the Dexcom G6, it has truly changed my life. At this point I had diabetes for 11 years and was fed up with all the promises about the latest and greatest in diabetes tech – even though some of these devices helped me, such as the G6 CGM. It felt as though each new flashy add-on came with a new challenge as well. I found myself at my endocrinologist’s office questioning recommendations for new test kits, smart pens, and smart anything that was newly available. ... This helps me with my dosing calculations throughout the day. I still like the non-Bluetooth version better, though, because the Bluetooth features do not always work. I often have problems related to the integration with my CGM; there are often calculation lags and issues showing insulin on board. I have hope that these kinds of bugs will be fixed, but for now I’m pretty content to keep track of how much insulin I gave myself, how long ago it was, and comparing it to my glucose levels at any given time. Plus, my Dexcom G6 allows me to monitor my glucose closely and make micro-adjustments accordingly. My personal experience with long-acting insulin has also improved significantly when I switched from Lantus to Tresiba. This meant that by the end of my time using a pump, my basal rates were consistent throughout the day, which helped me feel confident enough to make the jump away from an insulin pump. I don’t think I’d be able to handle such a low-tech way of dosing my insulin without the immense amount of information I get from my CGM. The G6 requires no calibrations except in rare circumstances, and I love the control it gives me throughout the day. If I see I’m rising unexpectedly, it’s easy to bring my glucose back down with a small dose of insulin.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Pumps are great but I spent nearly 20 years pumping with crap control. CGM is the key - do whatever you need to to get onto a reliable CGM (I have recently started on the Dexcom G6 and couldn't be happier). Then, some Omnipods are compatible with DIY looping, like AndroidAPS or Loop (on iOS). Look into those to really supercharge the benefit from the CGM.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "100% agree my docs rec'd the same, they also said if I am gonna eat I could just do half the bolus and then leave the basal rates as is. I've not started on my tandem so dont really have the advantage. Been trialling things when swimming and did manage to get it right once or twice with bgs as obviously i'm disconnected & away from my phone so no cgm which makes things more difficult.

      "Leave them to themselves.... As to the benefits of a pump, I can speak from direct experience. My first 39 years of t1d responsibility was injections, and the last 18 years on pump with Dexcom CGM added 6 years ago. The pump allows managing basal rates to match what I'm doing e.g., sleep, sedentary day, bike ride etc. I'm very physically active so thanks to the pump, lows are history.

These days, I’m pretty fortunate and I count my lucky stars because I’m in the employ of a career that provide medical coverage for everything I need. The insulin pump and continuous glucose monitoring has been a life-altering option that’s almost guaranteed to have added years to my life.

I think the refusal to order a new CGM is also something he \"benefits\" from, because now he doesn't have to see the damage he's causing to himself. He doesn't have to see the consequences of his choices on a device that gives him live, present data. Instead of feeling like shit down the road, a CGM shows you the effects of your decisions NOW. 2.

      "Omnipod user for the past six months or so, diabetic for 21 years. I was also very reluctant to venture into the wearable control territory because I was very self-conscious about my diabetes becoming ‘visible’. Chose the omnipod after I tried the Libre and Dexcom, also chose it specifically because its tubeless. 1. My omnipod will beep a few times the day its going to expire to let me know its on its way out, or whenever the reservoir drops to 20 units left. Its sort of annoying, but most of the time when the omnipod itself beeps no one really notices, since its inside of my clothing (I most often wear it on my stomach.) ... 3. I have a love/hate relationship with pump treatment. I think that there are MEGA advantages, like the ability to fine-tune your basal rates throughout a day automatically is amazing, and works much, much better than any long-acting insulin I’ve ever been on. My control for this reason has improved incredibly, and in combination with my dexcom I feel like I have learned SO much about how my habits, foods, body interact with my glucose levels and insulin doses. It’s an incredible learning tool for that. It’s also way more discrete to be able to dose insulin using the PDM when I’m eating out or at work than when I was on MDI.\n",

      "It does make life easier, but there are several different kinds and they work better for some people than others. I willingly went back to finger sticks for the remainder of the time I was on the Mini Med (about 1 year, insurance only allows me to switch pumps every several years) because I was having such bad luck with their cgm sensors. I know a lot of people swear by them but mine wouldn’t stay on, would randomly “expire” the day of/after application, and frequently give false readings. I use the dexcom now and I swear by it, but others hate it. Our disease makes us so reliant on technology that it can be really defeating to try something new, learn everything you can about it, and gain no benefit or worse have your blood sugars mess up more. I don’t know if your boyfriend is a pumper, but he may also be resistant because it truly sucks to be constantly connected to a foreign object. Imagine wearing a bandaid, without changing it, for 10-14 days straight. Even though the cgm adhesive barrier is so much more sterile than that, the idea of it if you haven’t tried it just sounds weird and gross and uncomfortable. Depending on how he processes information, the sheer volume of available data may be scary. I’m fairly open to trying new therapies, but I know a lot of people that are of the mindset “yeah, what I’m doing isn’t great, but changing it could be worse”.\n",

I don't think there's a magic age - it's as soon as your child can. I'm curious whether or not you have spoken to your endocrinologist about having your child get on a pump and CGM. There are many benefits, not least of which is having to use and carry around needles and insulin vials, and having to prick fingers etc. When used properly, they are great tools, and may foster independence sooner.\n",

      "Just to jump on the back of what everyone else is saying. CGM needle doesn't stay inside you, it just has a small needle inside the applicator that you dispose of. It leaves a small strip that monitors your sugars in your arm that is attached to the CGM comes out when you remove the CGM. Also doesn't hurt when you apply it. Why would you be embarrassed to wear a CGM? It's a small device that is at the top of your arm or stomach. Would you look down upon or feel sorry for someone who wears glasses? Both are to help people manage a condition that they didn't inflict upon themselves, both could live without but it helps an awful lot. I don't know about other CGMs but the libre can be used with a separate device that reads your sugars via NFC and receives alarms via Bluetooth for people who don't have a phone with these capabilities or simply want to use a separate device. I've only been diabetic for 18 months or so but the CGM changed my life. I got it after 6 months and absolutely would never go without it. Diabetes management is all about data and CGMs give you the most information you could possibly have about your blood sugars. ... It's a hormone that triggers your liver to release glucose so that you can function on a morning without eating. Some people have it happen at a similar time each day, some once they start moving. On a note about pumps, I move onto one in a month and the idea is that you get your insulin in a way replicates a pancreas so your blood sugars are more stable with less peaks and troughs (as you'd see with a CGM as you get a detailed graph of the information). I agree that it's a bit invasive on the body and wearing a pump definitely isn't for everyone, but the CGM doesn't feel this way, especially compared to the amount of times you're injecting each day. It's very small and never gets in the way and the benefits from it are incredible. I've found that having an endo has been incredibly useful for learning and managing my condition although it's a lot less frequent now that I can manage it well now.\n",

Just physically, I seldom know it's there which is important for me. And I can check my bg a dozens of times a day which makes me happy and healthier. ... So I switched back to syringes after about five years. This also brought my a1c way down. I will never go back to a pump unless it somehow becomes as non-intrusive as the CGM. Just no benefit in my case.\n",

Thanks to the trends that this meter indicates, I can anticipate what will happen with my glucose and be able to prevent both hypos and hypers, and in this way push myself to the maximum while training. Another great advantage is being able to see how the carbohydrates I eat act and thus not run out of fuel in the middle of a bike ride, a run or on swimming days.

My Endo talked about them a little bit once in awhile, but never pushed it. A CGM was my gateway device, and the increased control that came with that was great (alarms for nightime lows, etc.). Then I started to contemplate pump, especially that now there were pumps that communicated with CGMs. Still, the idea of the tubing really put me off. ... Being able to change your basal rates to match your needs throughout the day and the hybrid closed loop system changing the rates on its own to adjust for activity, increased or decreased BG levels is the game changer for me. It's wonderful and I love my pump. I ultimately chose the Tandem to go along with my Dexcom. Omnipod 5 wasn't quite on the market yet, and I was concerned about losing a whole pod, etc. if there was a site failure. Not to mention, my insurance covers 100% of the Tandem costs. ... I've had a couple site failures, but it hasn't been a big deal. I can see being a guy and the body hair being an issue.

I honestly prefer the arm placement over having it on my stomach (I have heard you can put the Libre elsewhere but it isn’t recommended to my knowledge).

As to accuracy I think the dexcom may be slightly better but both are within the margin of error for any meter.

      "I've been struggling with topic ever since I first came in touch with it about... 4 or 5 years ago: Back then an article was being released by a journalist who wore a cgm for I think a week and proceeded to tell her mostly US-based readers how \"awesome it is to wear such a device\" on a daily basis because she was able to tell when it was due to certain BG levels that she couldn't concentrate etc. However, this article was released at a time where price gouging for insulin in the US was at an all time high. (And it still is, let's not forget that.) I wish I could provide you with her article/blog entry but I cannot find it anymore... It left me and many others devastated to read about a topic that affects your personal everyday life in many stressful and exhausting ways as something that can \"easily improve a (non-diabetic) person's relationship to nutrition\", all while also having to fight for access to insulin and/or the devices themselves financially. Another downturn I see in those 'influencer-like' presentations of non-diabetics using CGM is a rather sociological problem: It fuels the narrative of \"I heard from a friend of a friend...\" or \"But my neighbour's best friend's brother...\" when CGM used by non-diabetics is shown as something *easy* and *life-improving*. Non-diabetics use CGM in a completely different set-up: they're not fighting against a diabetes of any type while wearing it. Yet there are said \"But I heard...\"-people and they could sooner or later misinterpret these differences as in for example \"How can you still complain about your diabetes, I thought you have a CGM?\" Yes. Those people are being a**holes themselves and the connection to health-influencers with CGM is rather indirect. But like I said: It **does** work as a fuel. --- **However** --- If anyone as a non-diabetic decides to spend their money on CGM I would not prevent them from buying it or from *being able* to buy it. I would only object to insurances funding/partaking of funding the costs while those who could be in actual states of need for improvement via CGM (diabetics) are being denied financially easier access. --- Yikes, rant over and out. I apologise for potential language mistakes since I'm not a native English writer and haven't written this much in one sitting for a long time!\n",

      "Some great news was announced regarding diabetes healthcare recently! Diabetes Canada recently announced that British Columbians who are aged 2 years and older living with diabetes and meet special authority criteria will now have access to the Dexcom G6 through BC Pharmacare. The Dexcom G6 is a continuous glucose monitor that I have talked about in my previous post. It basically tracks your blood sugar from going high or low, and keeps you in range 24/7. This is a life changing device for all type 1 diabetics. Dexcom G6 (Dexcom, 2020). I’m glad to say that right now I am using the freestyle libre 2, which is another continuous glucose monitor. It does cost me $400 a month straight out of my pocket, but it is completely life changing and hard to say no to. I’m hopeful when I complete my education that I will be able to obtain a job that helps cover some of these costs through insurance. ... Provinces across Canada have been joining this motion to have devices like this one covered by the government. I hope that Ontario is next for this motion, and that more Canadians that are type 1 diabetics can have easier and less stressful lives with this magic device. My favourite advertisement for the Dexcom G6 is the Youtube video of Nick Jonas (popstar, superstar, whatever you call him) discussing the Dexcom G6 using humour. I actually recently applied to a job in BC. It would only be a year contract which is nice, but I would love to live there and take advantage of this government program.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I’m talking about the continuous glucose monitor. Unless you have diabetes or sometimes hypoglycemia will insurance pay. But you still can get it filled - it’s just out of pocket.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I try not to make diabetes a public thing, but I wear a Dexcom and there are always ways that it can come up. I am actually trying to switch endos but it’s difficult because of the health insurance plan my family has.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm so jealous. I'm still trying to afford a new transmitter for the sensors I already have. My insurance doesn't cover dexcom at all.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I'm a type 2, but don't take the 4+ insulin injections a day I need to qualify for insurance to reimburse the Dexcom. I pay closer to $200/month, but I understand the Libre 3 will be $75/month. That's a pretty big difference, and potentially worth it. The Dexcom system seems awesome so far, but its just pricey. With the realtime aspect of the Libre 3, that makes a difference to people like me, I think (no scanning required).\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "How something like bronchitis can trigger this is mind-blowing, even after 16 years as T1. This has been probably the scariest week of my life, and I am scared to even talk to my boyfriend about how shaken I am. A day before all this started my insurance approved a Dexcom, and as of right now I have had it on for 3 days, and all day today I have stayed pretty level. I have neglected my health for a long time, partially due to poor mental health and just not caring. I don't know what I expect from posting this, maybe just getting it out there so it helps me cope a bit to get past these feelings.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "My insurance doesn't cover a CGM for Type 2, either. My doctor is working on it, but it's been an uphill battle so far. I'm on insulin and an injectable (and Metformin).\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Any issues with using Tricare Reserve Select (TRS)? My son is a 4 year-old type 1 and currently uses Omnipod and Dexcom G6. I currently have private insurance through my employer and they've been great with giving us everything we need but it's rather expensive. I just recently reenlisted in the reserves and I am thinking of going on TRS but hesitant to switch as I'm worried they won't accept everything or will fight me on his prescriptions.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "We have a mandatory insurance here called \"Krankenkasse\" which, depending on the model you choose, has different restrictions/requirements, but covers most of the costs (except for CHF 1'000. -/annum \"Selbstbehalt\" and a \"Franchise\" according to your Health Insurance Plan (Krankenkasse) . Also it's not unlimited, at least for the CGM; I have/had an annual quote. A few years back, I ordered my normal supply of 6 sensors, but since it was the end of the year, the Krankenkasse refused to pay for all of them, since I used my annual demand according to their small print.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Dexcom is no longer going to be supplying their products directly so I'm looking for a new supplier for all my cgm needs. Looking for something with no or low shipping costs and a relatively low price for supplies. Looking for any suggestions for good value suppliers, yes I do have insurance but supplies are not cheap as you all know.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I am a recent college grad and I have just started my full time job. My insurance through my job is United Healthcare and I have previously been on blue cross blue shield through my parents. I use Omnipod, Dexcom, and Humalog currently and was wondering what others experiences have been with United and these prescriptions. Any and all experiences/advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "I am a HUGE fan of the Dexcom G6. I’m currently fighting with my insurance for coverage (BCBS). They cover it with a fast acting insulin prescription, but my office prefers to prescribe only long acting unless post meal numbers are consistently high.\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Completely depends on the insurance company and how they cover it. It may even be under pharmacy benefits rather than durable medical. I would contact Dexcom, give them your insurance info, and see if they can figure it out. They have a whole department dedicated to that.\n",
